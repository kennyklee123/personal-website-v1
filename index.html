       <h1>About Me</h1>
       <img id ="Kenny" src="kennysouthpark.png" alt="kenny" width="125" height="125">
       <p> Hi my name is Kenny and I am from Los Angeles, California. I am currently a junior attending Cal Poly Pomona  majoring in Computer Science!
          In addition, I  choose this major as I grew up around a lot of computers and technology.  Though, a huge factor to me choosing this major was also
          due to being colorblind, specifically a type of red-green colorblindness.</p>

    <h1> These Are My Favorite Restraunts! </h1>
    <div>
      <h2 class = "a">Howlin Rays</h2>
      <figure>
        <img class = "resize" src="howlin2.jpg" alt="Howlin">
        <figcaption class = "clear">I am personally a huge fan of <a href = "http://www.howlinrays.com/">Howlin Rays</a>!
                            Howlin Rays serves Nashville style hot chicken and it is the best place to get this style of chicken
                            in Los Angeles in my opinion.  They have multiple spice levels and believe me, they do not mess around
                            with their spice, as they use Carolina Reapers and other how peppers in their Howlin spice level.
                            The wait for this restraunt is typically a few hours on the weekend, and one to two hours during the weekdays,
                            though there are instances where the times can be short like half a hour, or extremely long where its three to four hours.

      <h2 style="color:black;">Lucali</h2>
      <figure>
        <img class = "resize" src="lucali2.jpg" alt="Lucali">
        <figcaption class = "clear">Located in NYC, my favorite pizza joint ever is <a href = "https://www.lucalibrooklyn.com/">Lucali</a>!
                            I have tried many spots in NYC like Scarr's, Roberta's, Di Fara, Joes, and many more, but Lucali's is special.
                            I love thin crust pizza, and this places kill it!  The toppings are simple, the calzones are huge, but there
                            are a few caveats.  The service can be a hit or miss, and they are open at 5pm, with no reservations.  Though,
                            even Lucali knows this and they tell you to show before 5,  put your name down, go to a near by place to have a drink,
                            and they iwll call you when the table is ready!

        <img class = "resize" src="Philipe.jpg" alt="Philipe">
          <figcaption class = "clear"> Known for being the inventor of the French dip sandwhich, we have <a href = "https://www.philippes.com/">Philippes!</a>!
                              Philippe's has been open for 110 years, making it one of the oldest restaurants in Los Angeles. There are many options
                              to order from, but I personally love the pie here! Though, one of the biggest appeals to this place, is the memorabilia
                              and history at this restraunt.  They also do events, like when they sold French Dip sandwhiches for $1!
